Since competition is rife, keeping customers happy so they do not move their investments elsewhere is key to maintaining profitability.\n",

    "1. Ingest merged customer demographics and trading activity data\n",

    "3. Leverage the SparkML library to build a classification model that predicts whether a customer has a propensity to churn\n",

    "In a supervised classification problem such as churn risk classification, we have a true output and a model-generated predicted output for each data point. For this reason, the results for each data point can be assigned to one of four categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True Positive (TP) - label is positive and prediction is also positive\n",
    "2. True Negative (TN) - label is negative and prediction is also negative\n",

    "4. False Negative (FN) - label is positive but prediction is negative\n",
    "\n",
    "These four numbers are the building blocks for most classifier evaluation metrics. A fundamental point when considering classifier evaluation is that pure accuracy (i.e. was the prediction correct or incorrect) is not generally a good metric. The reason for this is because a dataset may be highly unbalanced. For example, if a model is designed to predict fraud from a dataset where 95% of the data points are not fraud and 5% of the data points are fraud, then a naive classifier that predicts not fraud, regardless of input, will be 95% accurate. For this reason, metrics like precision and recall are typically used because they take into account the type of error. In most applications there is some desired balance between precision and recall, which can be captured by combining the two into a single metric, called the F-measure.\n",
